# pokemon-database

### The project
This is a simple project that consumes the PokeAPI and displays all the data (pokemons) in the database page. When you click the button on each pokemon card, you are redirected to a page with some specific info about that pokemon. The design and responsiveness weren't the focus, so they aren't the best.

### Tools
The front-end part was made with HTML and CSS (Bootstrap); <br>
The back-end part was made with Python and Python's Flask library with Jinja syntax.
